# Architecture

## Boundaries per User Defaults
- Clearly outline the separation of concerns in user settings and defaults.
- Adherence to default user boundaries ensures predictable and reliable system behavior.

## Domain Clarity
- Define domains with explicit scope, ensuring each domain has a dedicated function and responsibility.

## Clean Interfaces
- Foster minimal coupling by designing transparent and well-documented interfaces.

## Service Composition
- Enable reusable and composable services for seamless scalability and maintainability.
