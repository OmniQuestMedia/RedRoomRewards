# Architecture

The system architecture underpins the entire application, ensuring reliability, scalability, and maintainability.

## High-Level Overview

- **Modular Design**: Each module operates independently, enabling flexibility and easy updates.
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Ensures the system can handle asynchronous operations efficiently.
- **Secure Communication**: Utilizes encrypted channels for data transmission.

## Components

- **Frontend**: A responsive web interface for user interactions.
- **Backend API**: Manages business logic and communicates with databases securely.
- **Database**: Stores all data persistently with strong ACID compliance.

## Deployment Strategy

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automates testing and deployment processes.
- **Containerization**: Ensures consistent environments using Docker.

## Development Standards

- Adheres to clean code best practices.
- Maintains thorough documentation for all system components.
