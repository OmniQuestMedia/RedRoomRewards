/**
 * Activity Feed Service (Placeholder)
 * 
 * This module will track user and model activity for reporting purposes.
 * Monitoring hooks are prepared for M1, implementation deferred to M2+.
 * 
 * Planned Features:
 * - User transaction timeline
 * - Model earnings feed
 * - Performance history
 * - Point balance changes
 * 
 * Metrics:
 * - ACTIVITY_FEED_EVENT: Track when feed events are generated
 * 
 * When implementing this service:
 * 1. Import MetricsLogger from '../metrics'
 * 2. Use MetricEventType.ACTIVITY_FEED_EVENT for all feed generation
 * 3. Add alerting for feed generation failures
 * 4. Consider caching strategy for high-traffic users
