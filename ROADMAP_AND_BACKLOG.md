## Milestone 1: MVP (Production-Grade Core)

### EPIC 1: Immutable Transaction Ledger
- [x] Implement append-only ledger for all point/balance changes
- [x] Record: user, event/source, amount, timestamp, ref/ids

### EPIC 2: API Contracts
- [x] `/api/v1/earn` (authenticated earning event, idempotent)
- [x] `/api/v1/redeem` (safe, double-spend resilient)
- [x] `/api/v1/balance` (balance/check endpoint)
- [x] `/api/v1/transactions` (full, filterable history)

### EPIC 3: Earning & Redemption Logic
- [x] Deterministic, replayable earning event logic
- [x] Configurable redemption flows and anti-fraud

### EPIC 4: Admin/Operator Interfaces
- [x] Operator-only audited APIs for manual adjustments
- [x] Reporting/dashboard module (read-only access)
- Loyalty dashboard covering base-vs-bonus points distinction.
- Improved liability tracking for upcoming point expiry buckets (enabled buckets track 1-7 days, 45, measure compliance gaps).
