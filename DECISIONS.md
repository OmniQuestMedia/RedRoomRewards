## Changelog & Key Decisions

### 2025-12-15

- Adopted COPILOT.md as authoritative spec checklist, enforced repo-wide.
- Versioned slot machine spec at v1.0, docs/specs/SLOT_MACHINE_SPEC_v1.0.md is now source of truth.
- Engineering standards unified across all token systems: all token-affecting logic must be immutable, auditorily logged, server-side, and never regressive.
- Add/modify features only via versioned specs and checklist.
