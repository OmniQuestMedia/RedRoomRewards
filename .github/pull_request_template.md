# Copilot Compliance Checklist

- [ ] I inventoried existing files before making changes
- [ ] I did not invent paths, configs, or dependencies
- [ ] I listed CREATE/OVERWRITE/EDIT/DELETE/RENAME operations with exact paths
- [ ] I avoided extra refactors and limited scope to the work order
- [ ] CI permissions follow least privilege
- [ ] There is only one source of truth for each workflow/config responsibility
